WIP

This is a full-stack Wiki project I've built using Next.js and React Hooks. It features documentation for
the video game IL-2 1946 -- one of the most underrated flight simulation games ever made, IMO.
Here you'll learn the tips and tricks to grok a variety of aircraft, or take a quiz to test your learning and reaction time!
Strap up and buckle tight, airman!

(The theme evolved first from Family Guy, to DCS, and then to what it is now, long story!)

Update 6/28: added timer functionality to quiz.
